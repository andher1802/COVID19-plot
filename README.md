# COVID19-plot

The start point of this code is the plotcountries.RMD file. 

Run PlotCountries.RMD in R, and change the name of the country and dates of the epidemic start and lockdown start. 

- Names of each country match with the names of the files on the cumulative and test-to-case files. (South Korea, is an special case due to the name that should match with the name of the file.)
